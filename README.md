# Portfolio Webpage
This is a single webpage that gives more information about myself. Especially highlighted are my background, interests, and contact information.

## Context of this Assignment
The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate my understanding of responsive web development. I used flexbox properties to design my webpage for smaller screens first, then larger screens.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Learnings from Project
For this project, I learned why, when styling a webpage, it is important to style for smaller screens first. Due to smaller screens having less space, designing the layout for this more restricted space will save time more time rather than starting with the larger screens.

## Future Plans for this Project
In the future, I intend to use and update my portfolio webpage. I will need it, so that future team members can look at my webpage and get a better understanding of who I am.
