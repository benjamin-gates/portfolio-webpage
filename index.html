              My name is Ben Gates. I am a software engineering flex student at
              Thinkful and am working towards my dream of being a
              <strong>full stack developer</strong>!
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked for 3 years as a math teacher at Fort Washakie High
              School and am ready to use the skills acquired from that position
              in software developing. My experience as a math teacher makes me
              special because I have built <em>communication</em> and
              <em>management</em> skills through the process.

            <p>
              Although I am new to web development, my interest in this field
              grows day by day. Growing up, I always enjoyed being
              <em>creative</em> through music or art and
              <em>solving challenging problems</em> via math classes, board
              games, or puzzles. Little did I know that becoming a web developer
              is the perfect way to combine these two disciplines!
            </p>
            <p>
              Being new, I know that I will need to look for insights and advice
              from other team members in my future software developing jobs.
              When I was a new teacher, the suggestions of other teachers and
              training from professional development sessions tended to become
              the information that stuck with me the most.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can write <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
              <strong>HTML</strong> and, <strong>CSS</strong> programming
              languages. In addition to the soft skills I mentioned above, I do
              have the ability to <em>build camaraderie</em> among team members
              and make the working environment fun. I also enjoy working through
              challenging problems where a solution seems impossible
            </p>
            <p>The services that I can provide include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Front-end development</li>
              <li>Back-end development and</li>
              <li>Web design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Outside of web development, I have other interests. I enjoy
              playing most sports, especially SpikeBall and Basketball. During
              the summers, I try and go hike in the outdoors and take my dog on
              regular runs. Also, just like any normal, sane person, I have an
              irrational love for good food.
