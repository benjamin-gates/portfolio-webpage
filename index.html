                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is Ben Gates. I am a Software Engineering Flex student at Thinkful and am working towards my dream of being a back-end developer!</p>
                <p>I am currently working as a high school math teacher at Fort Washakie High School in Wyoming. My experience as a math teacher makes me special, because I have built communication and management skills through the process.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Although I am new to web development, my interest in this field grows day by day. Growing up, I always enjoyed being creative through music or art and solving challenging problems via math classes, board games, or puzzles. Little did I know that becoming a web developer is the perfect way to combine these two disciplines!</p>
                <p>Being new, I know that I will need to look for insights and advice of other team members in my future software developing jobs. When I was a new teacher, the suggestions of other teachers and training from professional development sessions tended to become the information that stuck with me the most. </p>
                <p>I am able to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS programming languages. In addition to the soft skills I mentioned above, I do have an ability to build comaraderie among team members and make the working environment fun. I also enjoy working through challenging problems where a solution seems impossible</p>
                <p>Outside of web developing, I have other interests. I enjoy playing most sports, especially SpikeBall and Basketball. During the summers, I try and go hike in the outdoors and take my dog on regular runs. Also, just like any normal, sane person, I have an irrational love for good food.</p>

                    <h3>PuzzleClassroom</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this site will be to connect students to the exact teachers/mentors that they need. This is intended for students of all ages with any educational goal.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>GhostSite</h3>
                    <p>Many small, diamond-in-the-rough, rural Wyoming businesses have little to none presence on the web. The purpose of this site will be to provide a way for these businesses to connect with freelance developers who can build their site and maintain it.</p>
